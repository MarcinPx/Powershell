PowerShell script which is creating or reactivating AD accounts and
mailboxes in Active Directory, Exchange. Script will be scheduled by Windows Scheduler to
run every 24h on Active Directory Server. Script on beginning is establishing connection with
Exchange Server than is loading few csv’s files and creating objects of this files: csv with
new starters; csv with existing users which were working before for the company; all roles
csv’s files which contain list of AD security groups for each role, for the moment were 2 csv’s
implemented for 2 roles: ‘customersupport.csv’ and ‘analyst.csv’. Then is starting loop over
‘newusers.csv’ and start to creatiOU (AD accounts for users listed in ‘newusers.csv’, it is
setting this properties for each user: full name; designated OU(folder in active directory for
users accounts); given name; surname; login; password; set that password need to be changed
at first login; user title; company name; display name; department; set account as enabled;
putting description for the account; principal name in the system; line manager. Then is
checking what role user have and assign groups listed in role csv, after is going to sleep for
100 seconds for all this information to be repopulated to all systems (like different Active
Directory servers, Exchange servers that are interconnected). Then is starting to create
mailbox and setting these properties: display name, primary smtp (email address), other
information’s for mailbox setting are pulled from Active Directory based on login. Once is
finishing iterating for all listed users in ‘newusers.csv’ is starting the loop through
‘existinguser.csv’ and doing these tasks for each user: enabling account; resetting password;
set that password need to be changed at first login; enabling MAPI on mailbox which is the
communication that is needed for outlook application to work. Once is finishing with
iterating through ‘existinguser.csv’ is creating new file ‘createdusers.csv’ with all details for
new starters which will be use by another Python script in next task. At the end script is doing
some cleaning: deleting files that were done ‘newusers.csv and ‘existinguser.csv’; placing in
this same location new empty files ‘newusers.csv’, ‘existinguser.csv’ for future process by IT
department.
